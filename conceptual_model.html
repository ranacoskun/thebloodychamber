                    <p>After developing a theoretical model, the next step was to move towards a formal representation of
                        the domain using an ontological approach. This involves creating a conceptual model by reusing
                        existing schemas, vocabularies, and ontologies. To ensure coherence and consistency, it is
                        essential to replace the terms of the theoretical model with those taken from existing models.
                        The main ontology chosen in this step of the project were the following: <br>
                    <ul style="text-align:justify">
                        <li><strong>Schema.org</strong>, an ontology that covers a wide range of topics, including
                            businesses, events, people, products, places, and organizations. It is designed to be
                            compatible with existing standards and technologies, such as RDFa and JSON-LD. It is
                            continually evolving and being updated based on community feedback and emerging trends in
                            data modelling and web development, so we were able to find in Schema fitting classes and properties to describe various objects and relationships in our domain.</li>
                        <li><strong>FABIO</strong> ontology, that is aligned with the FRBR (Functional Requirements for
                            Bibliographic Records) model and is designed to represent bibliographic information, namely
                            the description of bibliographic entities like books, articles, and journals, as well as
                            relationships between these entities; it was particularly useful for us in order to describe the short stories included in "The Bloody Chamber".</li>
                        <li><strong>CIDOC-CRM</strong>, an ontology that describes cultural heritage information. It
                            provides a high-level conceptual framework for modelling objects, events, agents, and other
                            entities, and their relationships. It was particularly useful for us in order to accurately
                            define relationship, influences and references among literary/artistic works, people and
                            movements.</li>
                        <li><strong>DBpedia-OWL</strong> is an ontology that is derived from the DBpedia project, it
                            defines classes and properties for describing entities such as people, places, and
                            organizations, as well as their attributes and relationships; specifically, we chose
                            DBpedia-OWL to describe places and particular relationships among people.</li>
                        <li><strong>FOAF</strong> is an ontology that is used to describe people and their social
                            relationships, so we relied on it to describe the people in our domain.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p><p>Other fundamental classes, such as the ones describing the type of entity or the creator of a
                    certain work, were chosen from <strong>RDF</strong> and <strong>DCTerms</strong>, two very widely
                    used ontologies, in order to increase the level of interoperability. Initially, during this phase of the project,
                    we searched individually for the ontology terms that we thought were more fitting for describing our
                    items, but in a later stage we were careful to align our choices, with the purpose of creating a
                    coherent model and facilitating potential queries in our dataset. </p><p>A graphical representation of the formalization is necessary to express the conceptualization
                    activity. Tools such as Graffoo (Graphical Framework for OWL Ontologies) can be used to produce a graphical framework for OWL ontologies. </p>
